---------------------------------- Third-party code used in the creation of this app:

Certain aspects of this app were extremely difficult and the lack of videos and info online would have made it almost impossible to complete within the given deadline. There was a noticeable drop in available recourses after I initially finished with the images and moved on to handling video and audio clips, making progress here extremely tiresome. To combat this, I at times enlisted the help of ChatGPT and would work with it as a form of 'duel-programming' to give me code snippets of highly technical operations. The code was still adapted, integrated, improved, and tested by myself though and I didn't always receive fully working code the first try. All the code developed with the help of ChatGPT is clearly marked from start to finish of the code block.
